# Poems for Git Learning

This repository is a silly example to demonstrate for @wtollervey to show him
how GitHub and Git works.

Poems are stored in separate `foo.txt` files. Make changes to the poems in
these files, or add your own poems in their own text files.

## Setup

* Fork the repostory.
* Clone it locally.
* Make the changes you need.
* Create a PR.
* Rinse and repeat.
